# Progress

I have built a sample app and written the code to install the app onto a Shopify store. 

https://install.storelab.app 

The sample app is stored locally and I have successfully tested the install process while using ngrok to expose my localhost address. 

I am now trying to deploy the app code to eliminate the ngrok dependancy?
